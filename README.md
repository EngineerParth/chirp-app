# chirp-app 1.1
A social media app - Beta version contains entire app from front end to back end.It is based on the chrip app developed in MVA's MEAN Stack Jump Start program.
I have developed this while going through that program. I am not forking their project because I intend to develop it from scratch on my own, hopefully.
